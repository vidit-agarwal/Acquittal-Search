Be Cautious ::: (Guys be cautious with database , because this is the db that I have taken from a company , Their website is also running on this db , so be very cautious before doing anything related to db and ask me before using it !!!!!!)

DB : MySql db 

source : Amazon 

command to connect : mysql -h tblproduction.cmx4mndnhogx.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com -P 3306 -u root -p
		   --> It will ask for password : Password : Aniket2606

		--> IN the databse , we have to use db " machineLearning " (don't touch any other database)
